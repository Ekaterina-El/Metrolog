<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Application for metrology organizations with access rights separation and possibility of export to Excel. Allows you to store data about measuring instruments in a created enterprise hierarchy.

Each enterprise node is a subdivision that can store an unlimited number of measuring instruments, internal nodes. Each subdivision has a list of authorized persons, i.e. a flexible setting of the access level to each part of the enterprise.

Delimitation by level of access to subdivision/enterprise is implemented: 
- Owner;
- Level 1 Editor;
- Editor 2 level;
- Reader.

Each measurement tool has the following list of information sections:
- Passport;
- Overhaul;
- Running repair;
- Maintenance;
- Verification;
- Attestation;
- Change history.

A group of measuring instruments or a single measuring instrument can be exported in Excel with the required list of sections


In addition, all authorized persons of the unit are notified of the status of the measuring instruments in the unit and in the internal units. In case any means of the subdivision will require verification/calibration/certification etc. in the near future, or if the deadline has passed. 

For safety the "Defender" is introduced. Designed to protect data from unauthorized access from the device of an authorized user. The protection is a 5-digit numeric PIN code, which is set after successful authorization and is valid until the exit from the account.
